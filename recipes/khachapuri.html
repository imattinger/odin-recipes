    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Khachapuri, literally "cheese bread" in Georgian, is one of 
        Georgia's most iconic dishes. Though all varieties are delicious, 
        we will be making Adjaruli khachapuri, named for the Adjara region, 
        as its delightful boat shape makes it extra photogenic.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Dough</p>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Filling</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cheese - traditionally, a blend of imeruli and sulguni cheese,
            but if you're outside of Georgia, you probably won't find 
            these, so try a blend of feta and mozzarella
        </li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough.</li>
        <li>Roll out a square of dough. Place some shredded cheese, 
            about half the cheese you have, in two lines along two 
            opposite edges of the square. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll those edges in so that the lines of cheese are 
            covered, then keep rolling the edges toward each other 
            until the they meet in the middle. Grab each roll in 
            the center and gently pull them away from each other 
            to make a boat shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill the boat with the rest of the cheese. Put it on 
            a baking sheet and bake in the oven at 425Â°F for about 
            12-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the khachapuri out of the oven, add the egg yolk, 
            and pop it back in the oven for another minute or two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove khachapuri from the oven, top with butter, and 
            serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
